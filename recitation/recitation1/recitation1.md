# Setup Environment, Pseudocode, Simple Program
This week we’re setting up our coding environment, learn about pseudocode, and write a simple program. In computer science, an *algorithm* is a procedure to solve a problem *pseudocode* is what we use to write down an algorithm.


| **Algorithm**                                                | **Pseudocode** |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| An unambiguous specification of how to solve a problem.     | An informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm.|
| Helps to simplify and understand the problem.| A method of developing an algorithm.      |


Developers use pseudocode to plan out their real code, so there are no hard rules except that it needs to be easy to understand and easier to write than real code. See the Pseudocode examples from class slides and recitation for tips on how to write pseudocode.

# Exercises

1. Write an algorithm in pseudocode for the following program. The program will start by asking the user to enter 10 characters. Letters ‘a’, ‘e’, ‘i’, ‘o’, ‘u’ in the English alphabet are vowels. The program should count and display the total number of vowels among the 10 characters entered by the user. For example, if the user entered *ILoveSadie*, then the program should display:

`You entered 6 vowels`
